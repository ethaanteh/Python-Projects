# v1 
I made this because I wanted to try classes and I wanted to make a password generator as it was part of work i didn't finish in school
# v2 
I made this because i wanted to remake v1 with the options being as similar to the bitwarden password generator as possible but being text based. I wanted to make a user system with simple text files to expand my knowledge of file I/O without the hassle of making it properly encrypted since I wont actually be using it for storing passwords securely.
